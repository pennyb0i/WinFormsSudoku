# WinFormsSudoku
A classic game of sudoku, in Windows Forms

## How to play?
After opening the game, you can either generate a puzzle, load a previous puzzle, or type in a grid arrangement yourself.

Then by clicking `Start game` you start playing! The game will attempt to find a solution to the presented puzzle, to check your mistakes along the way.
If the provided puzzle is unsolvable, the game will let you know ðŸ˜‰. Keep in mind that if there are multiple solutions (not enough initial digits), the game will only consider a single solution as correct (kind of a bug). 

If you're lazy, you can press the `Solve` button to solve the game instantly

### Tired of playing?
You can save the game to a text file to return to it at a later date
